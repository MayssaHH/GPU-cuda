(1) The default parameters in this assignment perform a convolution on a
    4096x4096 input using a 5x5 filter and a 32x32 input tile.

    (a) What are the dimensions of the output tile?
    dimension of output tile = input tile dimension - 2 * filter radius
                             = 32 - 2 * 2
                             = 28 
    So, output tile is 28x28

    (b) What is the total number of ghost cells for the entire input?
    We know that each block loads a 32×32 input tile into shared memory, however only a 28×28 interior of that tile corresponds to output
    The remaining cells are ghost cells, now i want to find their total number for the entire input
    Since input tile is 32x32 and output tile is 28x28, we have for each tile 32^2 - 28^2 = 240 ghost cells
    Now, how many tiles we have? It's size of output / 28 
    Size of ouput is 4092x4092 (input - 2*padding)
    Number of tiles is output size / tile size = ceil(4092/28) = 147x147 = 21609 tiles
    Total ghost cells = 21609 * 240 = 5,186,160
        

(2) Assume we used a rectangular 5x7 filter instead. The convolution is still
    performed on a 4096x4096 input using a 32x32 input tile.

    (a) What are the dimensions of the output tile?
    dimension of output tile = input tile dimension - 2 * filter radius
                             = (32,32) - 2 * (2,3)
                             = (28,26)
    So, output tile is 28x26 

    (b) What is the total number of ghost cells for the entire input?
    We know that each block loads a 32×32 input tile into shared memory, however only a 28×26 interior of that tile corresponds to output
    The remaining cells are ghost cells, now i want to find their total number for the entire input
    Since input tile is 32x32 and output tile is 28x26, we have for each tile 32^2 - 28*26 = 296 ghost cells
    Now, how many tiles we have?
    output is (4096 - 4, 4096 - 6) = (4092,4090)
    in one dimension we need 4092/28 = 147 tiles and in one dimension we need 4090/26 = 158 tiles
    so we have 23,226 tiles 
    Total ghost cells = 23,226 * 296 = 6,874,896
